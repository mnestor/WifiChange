Modify the plist to set the location of the wifichange.sh script

Create files in the connect dir that are the name of the SSID you wish to run scripts on when you connect.

The file names should be the lowercase version of the SSID with spaces replaced with _
eg. "This Really Cool WIFI" you create the file "this_really_cool_wifi"

If you have a default.noscript then that executes when you don't have a matching script for the current SSID
